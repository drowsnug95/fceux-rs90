 FCEU320 v0.3 
 FCEUX port for OpenDingux
 -------------------------------------------------------------
 
 Thanks go to all people who worked on each incarnation of FCEU320: the_gama, ValdikSS and DiegoSLTS.
 
 The archive contains 3 files:
 fceu320/fceu320.dge - binary for legacy Dingux (Ritmix rzx50 and Dingoo a380/a320e) DO NOT USE FOR DINGOO A320 LEGACY DINGUX
 fceu320/fceu320-od.dge - binary for OpenDingux
 fc_emu.dge - bash-script replacement for native rzx50/a380/a320e emulators
 
 HOWTO INSTALL FOR RITMIX RZX-50 AND DINGOO A380/A320e:
 - copy folder fceu320 with its contents to "emulator" folder of inner flash-memory of your handheld
 - replace native fc_emu.dge with a replacement from the archive
 - disconnect and play
 
 What's changed comparing to DiegoSLTS's version:

 - CHANGED: All subsystems are back on SDL: video, sound, input and so on; minimal driver is removed completely.
   In fact it's vitually a new port.
 - ADDED: Thanks to new sound synchronizing with mutexes and conditions sound framerate is tweakable again: 8000 - 48000
   and it doesn't affect emulation speed anymore
 - ADDED: Most of Rshift + key combos are brought back (see Controls below)
 - ADDED: For Ritmix RZX-50 fullscreen upscales to 384x272
 - FIXED: Corrupt preview screen in load/save state options
 - FIXED: Screen corruption with scaler=original and clipsides=0
 - REMOVED: Sound thread priority option is removed as it has no sense anymore

Noticed bugs/features:
 - When sound is off, the framerate lowers to 50 fps
 - Upscalers 280x240 and 320x240 ignore 8 left and 8 right pixels (critical for some games)

 Changelog

 v0.3
 
 * Added file browser to GUI.
 * Rearenged all settings to three submenus: main, video and sound.
   Almost every original option is available now; like ntsc tv emulation, 
   PAL timming, individual nes apu channel volume, etc.
 * Added new 280x240 scaler in video settings.
 * Merged last svn revision (4/03/2010).
 * Added fcm and fm2 movie support.

   format in the /usr/home/.fceux folder.

   NOTE: There is no option to recover the default config yet.  So if you
         want to do that just remove the /local/home/.fceux/fceux.cfg file.
 * Added fractional frameskip (See features).
 * Replaced SDL driver with a minimal driver using Slaanesh's minimal
   library.

 --------------------------------------------------------
 v0.2

 * Fixed battery support for FDS games.
 * Fixed save state support for FDS games.
 + Added separate config file for each rom.
 + Added frameskip support.
 + Added small GUI for configuration and other options.
 + Added custom palette support.
 * Added one button fds disk switching.

 ISSUES

 - Small gameplay lag.
   NOTE: Please use elta's rootfs to reduce lag.
 - The fullscreen scaler always clips left
   and right 8 pixels columns from the nes screen.
 - IMPORTANT: Audio can get out of sync and some games play too
   fast, especially nsfs.  To avoid (lower) this
   issue please try changing the following settings:
   sound rate, cpu rate, frameskip and sound thread prioriy.
   

 Not supported

 - Movie record.  Actually it should work but i haven't tested
   it and there is currently no option to activate it in the GUI.
 - Hight quality sound (It is just too heavy :().
 - New ppu core (Just like hqsound :().
 - Family keyboard, Mahjong and other input devices that needs more
   than 10 buttons.


 TODO

 - Add movie record support.
 - Make splash screen (?).
 - VSync not supported.  NOTE: I read somewhere that the vsync 
   problem is related to the emulator itself.
